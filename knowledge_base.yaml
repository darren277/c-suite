          # Dashboard Usability Research
          
          ## Research Overview
          Conducted user interviews with 25 patients to understand dashboard usability issues.
          
          ## Key Findings
          1. **Navigation**: 60% of users couldn't find appointment scheduling
          2. **Information Hierarchy**: Health records were buried too deep
          3. **Mobile Experience**: 80% of users primarily use mobile
          
          ## Recommendations
          - Move appointment scheduling to top-level navigation
          - Create dedicated health records section
          - Prioritize mobile-first design
          
          ## Next Steps
          - Create wireframes for new navigation
          - Conduct A/B test with 100 users
          - Implement changes by end of Q4

          limiter = Limiter(
              app,
              key_func=lambda: request.remote_addr,
              default_limits=["100 per hour"]
          )
          ```
